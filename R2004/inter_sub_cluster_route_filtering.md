# 1. Introduction
Add a new extended community called origin sub-cluster in order to filter inter cluster routes correctly using policy.

# 2. Problem statement
Inside Contrail POP, and per customer, we must be able to match routes with some community tag in order to assign a local preference.
Other routes not matching the community tag must be rejected.

# 3. Proposed solution
We need to add sub-cluster extended community called origin-sub-cluster extended community to all routes originated within a sub-cluster (similar to origin-vn) by encoding sub-cluster-id as the value field inside the extended-community.
Also 0x85 was reserved from IANA for this new extended community.

Also we need to take care of below scenarios while applying policies:
1. Apply virtual-network policy to secondary routes too, but only if self sub-cluster id does not match with what associated with the route.
2. If there is no sub-cluster extended-community associated with the route, then we have to apply the policy for secondary routes.

## 3.1 Alternatives considered
None, this is a feature enchancement providing more flexibility.

# 4. Implementation

### Attach sub-cluster extended communities to all routes originating in that sub-cluster
Sub-cluster attribte is necessary in order to filter inter cluster routes correctly using policy.

BgpAttrPtr BgpTable::AddExtCommunitySubCluster will have the code logic for setting sub-cluster id in extended community
```
+BgpAttrPtr BgpTable::AddExtCommunitySubCluster(BgpAttr *attr,
+        uint16_t subcluster_id) {
+    ExtCommunityPtr ext_community = attr->ext_community();
+    if (!ext_community) {
+        return NULL;
+    }
+    SubCluster sc(server()->autonomous_system(), subcluster_id);
+    ext_community = server()->extcomm_db()->
+        ReplaceSubClusterAndLocate(ext_community.get(), sc.GetExtCommunity());
+    return server()->attr_db()->
+        ReplaceExtCommunityAndLocate(attr, ext_community);
+}
```
Now when we insert a new path to a route and if the path is a primary path then we need to add origin sub-cluster extended community in the bgp attribute list of the path.
We need to add below code to BgpRoute::InsertPath()
```
        if (table->IsRoutingPolicySupported()) {
+           if (!path->IsReplicated()) {
+               // Add sub-cluster extended community to all routes
+               // originated within a sub-cluster
+               BgpAttr *attr = new BgpAttr(*(path->GetAttr()));
+               uint16_t subcluster_id = SubClusterId();
+               if (subcluster_id) {
+                   BgpAttrPtr modified_attr = table->AddExtCommunitySubCluster(
+                           attr, subcluster_id);
+                   // Update the path with new set of attributes
+                   if (modified_attr) {
+                       path->SetAttr(modified_attr, path->GetOriginalAttr());
+                   }
+               }
+           }
```
### Apply virtual-network route policies to secondary route only if self sub-cluster id does not match with what is associated with the route.
For this to achieve, we need to the add below check in RoutingInstance::ProcessRoutingPolicy
```
 bool RoutingInstance::ProcessRoutingPolicy(const BgpRoute *route,
                                            BgpPath *path) const {
+    ExtCommunityPtr ext_community = path->GetAttr()->ext_community();
+    if (path->IsReplicated() &&
+            ext_community && ext_community->GetSubClusterId()) {
+        //If self sub-cluster id macthes with what is associated with the route
+        //then no need to apply policy.
+        if (route->SubClusterId() == ext_community->GetSubClusterId()) {
+            return true;
+        }
+    }
```

### Parse new extended community subcluster```:<as>:<number>```
We need to implement FromString() and ToString() methods.
Allow user to configure this in a routing-policy match or action.
Provide support for both 2 byte and 4 byte as formats.

# 5. Performance and scaling impact
None.

# 6. Change in existing behaviour
Yes, as we have changed the way we are going to apply the virtual-network policy

# 7. Upgrade
None.

# 8. Deprecations
None.

# 9. Dependencies
None.

# 10. Testing
## 10.1 Unit tests
1. Need to add and update test-cases in routing_policy_test.cc to verfiy the change in behaviour of how routing policies are applied to secondary path.

2. Need to add sub_cluster_test.cc to test whether sub-cluster extended communities is applied to all the routes originating in a sub-cluster.
