      "message": "It seems based on the defined charms, kube-manager always runs in the kubernetes-master even though the contrail controller can run in diffrent kubernetes-node. we always prefer to run kube-manager where contrail controller runs. kube-manager is not tightly coupled with contrail-controller or kubernetes-master when contrail-ansible-deployer is used. It can be launched anywhere. It should be taken care if contrail-controller and kubernetes-master can run in diffrent nodes with charms.",
