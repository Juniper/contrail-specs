# 1. Introduction
Today, the control-node gets the user configuration from the configuration 
database (i.e., cassandra) and sends the relevant config data to all the 
compute nodes that have peered with it (via XMPP). Control-node also consumes
some config data (e.g., BGP configuration). With the introduction of ATOM 
(a new common infra for applications such as contrail), Cassandra will be 
replaced by MySQL and RabbitMQ, with ETCD. As a result, we need to change 
the control-node config handling infrastructure to add support for 
retrieving user configuration from MySQL as well using ETCD.


# 2. Problem statement
Post 4.1 release and until today, the control-node retrieves user configuration 
by reading the cassandra client database. This is done whenever control-node 
boots up or restarts. In addition, it subscribes as a RabbitMQ client to listen 
to any changes (Add/Delete/Update) to the configuration data. As mentioned 
earlier, with the introduction of a common infra (ATOM) for controllers, 
contrail will now need the ability to use the new infra. The new infrastructure 
uses MySQL instead of Cassandra as its database. Also, the RabbitMQ client has 
been replaced with ETCD which is known to work well with MySQL based systems. 
ETCD acts as a one-stop shop for listening and retrieving all configuration 
related changes as opposed to today where we have to subscribe to RabbitMQ to 
listen for updates while reading user configuration directly from Cassandra.
Accordingly, we will enhance the current control-node behavior to add support 
for retrieval of user configuration from MySQL as well using ETCD. We will 
continue to support the cassandra based config handling infrastructure for 
existing users.

# 3. Proposed solution
We will be adding a new c++ based ETCD client library to retrieve new user 
configuration and updates from the golang-based ETCD server. There are two ways 
in which ETCD clients can communicate with the server to get the data: HTTP 
based Curl and GRPC. With the proposed solution, we will be using GRPC to 
communicate with the server. In addition, we will be making changes to existing 
modules that handle configuration data to add support for retrieving and 
handling the data from ETCD. There will also be a new knob introduced in the 
configuration file to allow users to choose between the two.

We do not expect any change to schema, workflow or UI. The new logs for the new 
modules are TBD.

## 3.1 Alternatives considered
N/A

## 3.2 API schema changes
None

## 3.3 User workflow impact
Users will have the ability to choose either a Cassandra based system or an 
ETCD based MySQL system via a config knob for handling the user configuration. 
Other than that there is no workflow impact for the users in terms of the 
functionality.

## 3.4 UI changes
None

## 3.5 Notification impact
New logs and appropriate UVE changes will be introduced to support the new ETCD 
based config retrieval feature.

# 4. Implementation
## 4.1 Work items
There will be one new module:

a. c++ based ETCD-Client-Library This module is responsible for interacting 
with the Golang based ETCD server which retrieves and maintains the user 
configuration from the MySQL database in JSON format. Support will be added 
to READ user configuration as well as WATCH for any changes (Add/Delete/Update) 
to individual configuration items. As mentioned earlier, GRPC will be the 
communication mechanism used between the ETCD client and server. We will be 
using the standard proto files available with GRPC.

In addition, the following existing modules will be enhanced to support the new 
infrastructure:

a. Config-Client-Manager This module oversees retrieval of user configuration. 
It currently interacts with the following modules to retrieve and handle user 
configuration.

(i) Config-Cassandra-Client This module interacts with the cassandra servers. 
It also performs connection-management and issues read requests actions for the 
cassandra database holding the user configuration.

(ii) RabbitMQ-Client This module interacts with the RabbitMQ servers. Its 
function is to retrieve information about the operation (Add/Delete/Change) and 
the configuration item on which the operation will apply.

(iii) Config-Cassandra-Parser This module parses the configuration received by 
the cassandra client from the cassandra server.

With the proposed changes, the Config-Client-Manager will also interact with 

(iv) Etcd-Cassandra-Client This module will combines the functionality of both 
Config-Cassandra-Client and the RabbitMQ-Client. It will interact with the ETCD 
client library to both retrieve bulk configuration (when control-node comes up 
or restarts) and watch for any changes (Add/Delete/Update) to get information 
about the operation and the configuration item on which the operation will 
apply.

In addition, the Config-Client-Manager will have the ability to choose one 
infra over the other (Cassandra vs MySQL) based on a config knob in the 
configuration file.

We will add tests for all the new functionality, change existing tests to work 
with the new modules, add introspect functionality to peak into the new modules 
and also add/update introspect functionality interacting with the new modules.

# 5. Performance and scaling impact
TBD

# 6. Upgrade

The changes are only in the control-node. There should be no operational impact 
when we replace all control-nodes. In the case, where only a subset of 
control-nodes are upgraded, the data stored in the older-version and the 
newer-version control-nodes will be the same.

# 7. Deprecations
None

# 8. Dependencies
None

# 9. Testing
## 9.1 Unit tests
The current automation suite will be enhanced to add tests for the new ETCD 
based config retrieval system. Efforts will be made to make sure that the test 
coverage will be on par with the current tests for Cassandra based systems.

## 9.2 Dev tests
TBD

## 9.3 System tests
TBD

# 10. Documentation Impact
TBD

# 11. References
None
