# 1. Introduction
A new object, called Device Functional Group, is introduced to apply 
certain properties to a user-specified group of devices during ZTP and RMA.

# 2. Problem statement
Contrail fabric management currently provides pre-defined Node Profiles to 
provide certain properties, such as supported routing-bridging groups, 
for a specified class of devices. Node Profiles are defined on a 
per-vendor-family basis, e.g. Juniper QFX 5K.
For certain operations, like OS version upgrade and role assignment,
we want the ability to assign properties to a user-defined group of devices
instead of a grouping defined by Node Profiles. These properties can be
applied during ZTP or device RMA.

# 3. Proposed solution
We introduce a new object, Device Functional Group (DFG), to contain os_version,
physical_role, rb_routing_roles in the first phase. Other attributes can
be added in future releases. A certain set of pre-defined DFGs
will be provided in hopes of covering most typical scenarios. We will also
provide the ability to add new DFGs on the fly.

Device Functional Groups will initially be used only during ZTP and RMA,
but can be extended for other uses in the future. DFGs must be configured 
before ZTP or RMA is executed. In order for DFGs to be used, 
the user is required to specify DFG name in the Device Info input file 
during fabric creation in the UI.

Here are the steps to using Device Functional Groups during ZTP:

1) Create new DFGs via UI (optional). Specify an os_version, physical_role
(leaf, spine) and routing-bridging-role(s) via pull down menus. Note that
there will be several default DFGs provided. See details in later sections.
2) User edits the Device Info file given during ZTP. A new optional per-device attribute
called "Device Functional Group" can be specified for each device to give
the name of the DFG to be used during ZTP or RMA activation.
3) During the early stages of ZTP, the Device Info file is parsed and the
DFGs are validated to exist. If any DFG does not exist, an error is thrown.
4) For each device with a DFG specified in the Device Info file, a reference
is drawn between the device's physical-router object and device-functional-group object.
5) During the image upgrade step of ZTP, if a device has a device-functional-group
reference and a device-functional-group-os-version is specified, and the 
os-version exists for that family,
then the image is upgraded to that version. Otherwise, the fabric-wide os-version
is used, or none is used for image upgrade.
6) As the last step of ZTP, the role assignment job playbook will now be called.
For each device which has device-functional-group->device-functional-group-physical-role
and/or device-functional-group->device-functional-group-routing-bridging-roles defined,
the role assignment playbook will be called to assign those roles to the device.
If the roles are not specified, then the existing behavior is applied where
the user is given the option to apply roles manually.

Here are the steps to using Device Functional Groups during RMA:

1) The device physical-router object should already have a reference to DFG.
2) During the image upgrade step of RMA activation, if a device has a device-functional-group
reference and a device-functional-group-os-version is specified, and the 
os-version exists for that family,
then the image is upgraded to that version. Otherwise, the fabric-wide os-version
is used, or none is used for image upgrade.
3) Since the physical-router is already assigned roles during onboarding,
there is no need to use device-functional-group->device-functional-group-physical-role
or device-functional-group->device-functional-group-routing-bridging-roles
during RMA activation. The roles and associated overlay configuration are
already getting pushed during RMA activation.

# 4. User workflow impact

1) The user will optionally configure a Device Functional Group before
onboarding a fabric.
2) The user will be required to edit the Device Info file given during ZTP. 
A new optional per-device attribute called "device_functional_group" can 
be specified for each device to give the name of the DFG to be used during 
ZTP or RMA activation.
3) If DFGs are specified on all devices, the user will be able to skip the
role assignment step of the onboarding wizard.

# 5. API schema changes

#### Device Functional Group Object
There will be a new object with the following schema definition:

```
<xsd:element name="device-functional-group" type="ifmap:IdentityType"
    description="Device functional group is used to group together any selected list of devices for the purpose of assigning identical attributes. For example, os-version, physical-roles, rb-roles"/>

<xsd:element name="device-functional-group-os-version" type="xsd:string"/>
<!--#IFMAP-SEMANTICS-IDL
          Property('device-functional-group-os-version', 'device-functional-group', 'optional', 'CRUD',
              'OS version for devices in this group. If set, it is the first choice for device image upgrade during ztp. If not set, fabric-os-version is used') -->

<xsd:element name="device-functional-group-routing-bridging-roles" type="RoutingBridgingRolesType"/>
<!--#IFMAP-SEMANTICS-IDL
          Property('routing-bridging-roles', 'device-functional-group', 'optional', 'CRUD',
              'Routing-bridging role (e.g. CRB, ERB, etc.), used by the device manager to provision physical router, for e.g device manager may choose to configure physical router based on its role.') -->

<xsd:element name="device-functional-group-physical-role"/>
<!--#IFMAP-SEMANTICS-IDL
          Link('device-functional-group-physical-role', 'device-functional-group', 'physical-role', ['ref'], 'optional', 'CRUD',
             'Physical role assigned to all physical routers which are members of this device functional group') -->

<xsd:element name="physical-router-device-functional-group"/>
<!--#IFMAP-SEMANTICS-IDL
          Link('physical-router-device-functional-group',
             'physical-router', 'device-functional-group', ['ref'], 'optional', 'CRUD',
             'Device functional group that this physical-router belongs to.') -->
```


# 6. Implementation

- Pre-defined DFGs will be added to predef_payloads.py
- Use the existing role assignment playbook at the end of the ZTP workflow
to automatically assign roles to devices if provided in the Device Info file.
- Use existing per-fabric os-version logic, where possible, to extend to
using DFG os-version.

# 7. UI Changes
(screen samples TBD, pending UX design)

We expect to display a new "Device Functional Groups" tab when clicking 
Fabrics, at the same level as Fabrics, Node Profiles and OS Images.
The Device Functional Group page will display a list of DFGs with these
attributes:

1) Name
2) Description
3) physical role
4) routing-bridging roles (list)
5) OS version
6) Associated device hostnames

<img src="images/device_functional_group_2.png" alt="drawing" height=400 width="1000"/>

When selecting a particular DFG, the description, physical role, routing-bridging roles,
and OS version should all be editable. The physical role, routing-bridging roles,
and OS version fields should be pull-down menus.

The user should be able to create new Device Functional Groups from the UI.
 
The pre-defined DFGs are read-only and should not be allowed to be modified
(need to verify).
