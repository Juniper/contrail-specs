# 1. Introduction
This is to define the requirements for Tungsten Fabric security vulnerability hardening.
"A security vulnerability is a weakness in a product that could allow an attacker to compromise the integrity, availability, or confidentiality of that product." - [Source](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc751383.aspx)

# 2. Problem statement
Any networking connected software is vulnerable to security weakness. Tungsten Fabric, as a key controller to the networking infrastructure, is required to pass the most stringent security vulnerability scrutiny.

The areas of concerns for Tungsten Fabric include, but not limited to:

```
* Web UI
* Scripts vulnerability
* Object code vulnerability
* Computer Virus
* Denial of Service (DoOS) Attack
* Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)

```
