# 1. Introduction
Security vulnerability hardening is to make efforts to reduce the potential risks due to the weakness in the software to be exploited by threats/hackers.

# 2. Problem statement
Common types of security vulnerabilities include:
a. Software defects, e.g., buffer overflows, dangling points, uninitialized variables, which cause system instability as well as unpredictability.
b. Insufficient input validation making it exploitable via code injection, cross-site script (XSS), leading to denial of service or taken over control by the hackers.
c. Privilege escalation where an unprivileged account gaining privilege permissions, e.g., cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
d. Identity spoofing, e.g., SQL injection.
e. Network attacks causing by insecure open ports as well as weak passwords.
f. Insecure SSL encryption algorithms that have to be removed from the SSL negation options so that a stronger encryption will be chosen.
g. Computer viruses.
# 3. Proposed solution
There is no solution that can warrant a vulnerability free software because defects/weakness will be discovered as time goes. The most common strategy is to harden based on the latest tools and knowledge and patch fixes promptly when new ones are identified. Below are known tools that can be used to detect potential security vulnerabilities:
### Open Source Tools
a. OpenStack Bandit: "Bandit is a security linter for Python source code, utilizing the ast module from the Python standard library."
b. nmap: Network port scanner, described in "2-e".
c. ClamAV: Scan computer viruses described in "2-g".
d. OpenVAS: Nessus scanner fork before it went commercialization.
e. Metasploit Framework: Penetration testing. It has a commercial version that covers more grounds.
### Commercial Tools
a. Nessus Profession: Network security, XSS, Cookie Injections, etc.
b. Burp Suite Profession Edition: Web security scanner, e.g., SQL/Python Injection, SSL Certificate, XSS, CSRF, etc.
c. Protecode: Source code license detection (copyleft, GPL, LGPL, etc.), CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures), etc.
d. Coverity: Static code analysis to detect software defects described in "2-a".

## 4.1 Work items
Based on the scan results, maybe third party libraries need to be updated and API calls need to reflect the new API changes. If it's not in the third party libraries, then code detected need to change, which may affect other code.
It's usually case-by-case.
