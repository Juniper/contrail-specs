# 1. Introduction
Contrail TSN node currently acts as a DHCP server for Managed BMS.

# 2. Problem statement
Customers would liked to be given an option to use their own DHCP servers instead of being forced to use the TSN node.

#### Supported Device Models
QFX5k, QFX10k

#### Software Releases
Junos 18.4R2 and onwards

# 3. Proposed solution
Allow the user/customer to provide DHCP server(s) information while adding Logical Router (LR).
There are three scenerios that needs to be handled depending on where the DHCP server is located:
DHCP server is-

1. Within the same LR/VN
2. Reachable via default RI
3. In a different LR (Not in the current scope. Will be part of LR-Interconnect feature)

## 3.1 Alternatives considered
#### N/A

## 3.2 API schema changes
Add optional DHCP-Relay list field in Logical Router object.

## 3.3 User workflow impact
User will have to provide DHCP Server(s) info during LR create.

## 3.4 UI changes
On Overlay->Logical Router page,  optional additional field for the user to enter 'DHCP Server' IP.
User can add multiple servers.

## 3.5 Notification impact
#### N/A

# 4. Implementation
## 4.1
Device Manager gets an update for LR create/update. If DHCP relay info is found, we first identify

### 4.1.1
If it resides in the same subnet as the VN. Following config is pushed to the leaf/spine to which the LR is extended:
  ```
    set routing-instances <vrfname> forwarding-options dhcp-relay forward-only
    set routing-instances <vrfname> forwarding-options dhcp-relay forward-only-replies
     set routing-instances <vrfname> forwarding-options dhcp-relay server-group DHCP_SERVER_GROUP <dhcp-server-ip>
     set routing-instances <vrfname> forwarding-options dhcp-relay active-server-group DHCP_SERVER_GROUP
    set routing-instances <vrfname> forwarding-options dhcp-relay group RELAY_DHCP_SERVER_GROUP interface <irb>
    set interfaces irb unit <irb-uint> family inet address <irb-ip> preferred
  ```
IF multiple DHCP server ips, they would be added under the same relay group:
  ```
     set routing-instances <vrfname> forwarding-options dhcp-relay server-group DHCP_SERVER_GROUP <dhcp-server-ip>
  ```

IF multiple VNs are part of the same LR, all irbs would be configured under the same VRF:
  ```
    set routing-instances <vrfname> forwarding-options dhcp-relay group RELAY_DHCP_SERVER_GROUP interface <irb(n)>
  ```

### 4.1.2
If not, we need to leak routes to inet.0. In which case besides the generic dhcp relay config (mentioned above) we push the below additional config:

Route from LR to inet.0 -
  Static Route add for every DHCP server:
  ```
    set routing-instances <vrfname> routing-options static route <dhcp-server-ip> next-table inet.0
  ```
Route from inet.0 to LR -
  Static route add for every irb ip:
  ```
    set routing-options static route <irb-ip> next-table <vrfname>.inet.0
  ```


# 5. Performance and scaling impact
## 5.1 API and control plane
#### N/A

## 5.2 Forwarding performance
#### N/A

# 6. Upgrade
#### Backward compatible changes

# 7. Deprecations
#### N/A

# 8. Dependencies


# 9. Testing
## 9.1 Unit tests
Unit tests for Device Manager Ansible abstract config validation will be covered.
Note:
Since CFM Ansible config push implementation does not have any unit tests or unit test infrastructure, they are not in the scope of this feature.

## 9.2 Dev tests
The acceptance tests that will be identified will be automated.

## 9.3 System tests

# 10. Documentation Impact
The scenerio where DHCP server resides in a different LR not being supported needs to be documented.
