# 1. Introduction
This document provides a brief description of the appearance and functionality of the new menu.
# 2. Problem statement
The Mega Menu is too extensive, hence is not intuitive. Feedback has been provided during CEM Workshop, and here are the arguments for this change: 
1. There are two S Groups (Security Group and Service Group), which can be easily confused.
2. There are two networks: Networks, Virtual Networks.
3. The menu should “look and feel” as other Juniper products.

# 3. Proposed solution
The Mega Menu will be removed and part of the breadcrumb responsible for opening it will be not clickable anymore. For the replacement, the side panel will get introduced which will list existing categories.
# 4. UI changes

### New features
##### Adding Tier 2 items to Favorites category
The top category on the left side panel is called Favorites, and it is initially empty. The category displays only Tier 2 items once the user selects his favorites.
Aside from each Tier 2 item, the user has the pin that he can click to add that item to Favorites.
Once he clicks the pin, that Tier 2 item will be added to the top category - Favorites.
The user can unpin an item. Once he does that, the item will disappear from the Favorites category.

##### Reordering Tier 2 items under the Favorites category
The user can reorder Tier 2 items under the Favorites category. It can be achieved by a drag & drop functionality.
