# 1. Introduction
This document describes the idea behind Contrail VMware fabric integration to manage VMware underlay networks

# 2. Problem statement

Currently VMware stack: vCenter + ESXi hosts lacks of good user experience automation for underlay DC infrastructure. The purpose of this project is to provide such automation.

## Sample usecase:

## Initial situation:
Customer with ESXi hosts under vCenter management where Distributed Virtual Switch (DVS)
and Distributed Portgrups (DPG) solutions are widely used.

## Expected situation:
Contrail in this case will be an automation tool to extend the management of ESXi hosts via
vCenter to the DC infrastructure. This will provide completely automated connectivity
for VMs running under ESXi hosts.

# 3. Proposed solution
As part of Contrail's VMware fabric installation Contrail vCenter Fabric Manager (further named CVFM) plugin will be deployed. The purpose of CVFM plugin is to synchronize the configuration of VMware Distributed Portgroups with the configuration on TOR (Leaf) switch (like QFX) port connected to the host (ESXi) where this Distributed Port Groups have active instance of VMâ€™s. This will allow customers to configure the VLAN on Distributed Port Group of the Distributed Virtual Switch and have that VLAN configuration reflect on the switch port connected to the host.

# 4. User workflow impact

# 5. References

# 6. UI changes

## Case 1 - cluster provisioning
The user can deploy CVFM on selected control nodes during cluster provisioning. Manage vCenter checkbox in the enabled state shows a form where the user needs to put vCenter credentials.

## Case 2.a - vCenter deployment on brought up cluster
If the user has not decided to deploy CVFM during cluster provisioning, he still can do it by clicking Manage vCenter button in Cluster Overview page. Control nodes list and inputs for credentials are available.

## Case 2.b - vCenter update on brought up cluster
An update of vCenter credentials is possible on a brought up cluster. Clicking Manage vCenter button in Cluster Overview page shows a modal with vCenter credentials form. What is more, user can select existing control nodes and deploy on them CVFM plugin.

## Case 3 - ESXi hosts discovery
Navigate to Servers tab and click on Servers Discovery. ESXi hosts discovering can be achieved by selecting ESXi type option and executing a job.
