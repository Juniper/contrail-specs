      "message": "This change introduces new concept of placing private containers into open-source codebase (contrail-container-builder) of Tungsten Fabric. Besides that it places private code parts into open-source codebase of other modules (ansible-deployer, ...).\nI\u0027m not sure such a change can be accepted by community.\nSukhdev or Carlo could ask about such a change during community workstream meetings. I can also do this if you want.\nArchitecturally I think it would be more clean to separate private commercial parts from public open-source ones everywhere, i.e. put new container into some private container repo (where contrail command lives, for example), and have other private repos hold other pieces like roles for ansible-deployer.\nAs for JuJu, RHOSP and Helm, it is to be decided how to store such changes in them if they are required. So I suggest to resolve this private/public placement problem architecturally first and then proceed with implementation.",
