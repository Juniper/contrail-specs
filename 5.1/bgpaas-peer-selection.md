# 1. Introduction
Service Providers are relying on bgpass for routing from/to VNF.
VNFs are made up of several nodes spread on diffrent computes.
It will usually rely on two bgp peers for High Availablity.
All BGP peers from a VNF can be terminated on a same control node.
If the control node fails, both primary and backup peer get lost at
a same time. It will break the High Availablity.

# 2. Problem statement
The bgpaas has to support peer selection.
Configuration option would be provided in bgpaas to choose the control
node where it has to be peered.

# 3. Proposed solution
In the bgpaas configuration, option would be provided to choose
primary and secondary controller. Existing model would be followed
if controller is not configured in the bgpaas.

## 3.1 Alternatives considered None.

## 3.2 API schema changes
bgp-as-a-service is already linked with bgp-router. Attribute would be provided
in this link to find the primary and secondary controller.

## 3.3 User workflow impact
user is expected to configure primary and secondary controller in the bgpaas.

## 3.4 UI changes
Option to configure primary and secondary controller in the bgpaas.
UI will show only discovered controll nodes.

## 3.5 Notification impact

# 4. Implementation

## 4.1 Work items

### 4.1.1 Vrouter Agent changes
Contrail-vrouter-agent will get primary and secondary controller from
the attribute of bgpaas-bgp-router. If VNF uses x.x.x.1, agent will
make the peer with primary controller. If VNF uses x.x.x.2, agent will
make the peer with seconday controller. If there is no controller
configured, it will follow the existing model(choose first xmpp server for
x.x.x.1 and second xmpp server for x.x.x.2)

### 4.1.2 Vrouter changes
There is no vrouter changes.

## 4.2 Limitations

# 5. Performance and scaling impact
## 5.1 API and control plane
#### Scaling and performance for API and control plane

## 5.2 Forwarding performance
#### Scaling and performance for API and forwarding

# 6. Upgrade
None

# 7. Deprecations
None

# 8. Dependencies
None.

# 9. Testing
## 9.1 Unit tests
a) Configure bgpaas with primary/secondary controller and check it is peered with configued one
b) Confiugre bgpaas without controller and check it is working in the existing model.

## 9.2 System tests
