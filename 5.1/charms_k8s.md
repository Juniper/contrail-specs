Juju charms to deploy Contrail using Kubernetes orchestrator
============================================================

# 1. Introduction

This feature's purpose is to allow deployment of Contrail with Kubernetes using JuJu charms.

# 2. Problem statement

Juju charms for Contrail services currently support the deployment of Contrail with OpenStack.
Additional charms are proposed for the deployment of Contrail with Kubernetes.

# 3. Proposed solution

## 3.1 Deploying Contrail with Kubernetes will be based on existing Contrail charms:

- contrail-agent
- contrail-analytics
- contrail-analyticsdb
- contrail-controller

## 3.2 Additional charms must be implemented:

- contrail-kubernetes-master
- contrail-kubernetes-node

## 3.3 The Charmed Distribution Of Kubernetes will be used:
https://jujucharms.com/canonical-kubernetes/

## 3.4 Nested mode

Contrail supports the provisioning of Kubernetes cluster inside an OpenStack cluster. The contrail-kubernetes-master and the contrail-kubernetes-node charms interface directly with Contrail components that manage the OpenStack cluster. No other Contrail charms are needed in nested mode.

# 4. Implementation

## 4.1. Additional charms

### 4.1.1 Contrail-kubernetes-master

The contrail-kubernetes-master charm installs the contrail-kubernetes-kube-manager docker container.

Proposed definition of charm metadata:

```
requires:
  contrail-controller:
    interface: contrail-controller
  kube-api-endpoint:
    interface: http
    scope: container
provides:
  contrail-kubernetes-config:
    interface: contrail-kubernetes-config
  nrpe-external-master:
    interface: nrpe-external-master
    scope: container
subordinate: true
```

The charm will be defined as a subordinate for deployment on the same node where kubectl is available.

### 4.1.2 Contrail-kubernetes-node

The contrail-kubernetes-node charm installs the contrail-kubernetes-cni-init docker container.

The charm will be defined as a subordinate for deployment on the same nodes as the contrail-agent charms.

Proposed definition of charm metadata:

```
requires:
  cni:
    interface: kubernetes-cni
    scope: container
  contrail-kubernetes-config:
    interface: contrail-kubernetes-config
subordinate: true
```

## 4.2 API schema

### 4.2.1 Contrail-kubernetes-master

- contrail-controller relation will use the existing relation of contrail-controller charm to get the Contrail configuration. In a nested-mode deployment, the Contrail configuration will be provided in the charm config, and the contrail-controller relation is not used
- contrail-kubernetes-config relation will provide Kubernetes pod subnets configuration
- kube-api-endpoint relation will use the existing relation of Kubernetes Master charm to get kubernetes API configuration
- nrpe-external-master relation will provide status monitoring

### 4.2.2 Contrail-kubernetes-node

- contrail-kubernetes-config relation will provide Kubernetes pod subnets configuration
- cni relation will be used for setting up the kubernetes-master and kubernetes-worker charms.

## 4.3 User workflow impact

None

## 4.4 UI Changes

None

# 5. Performance and scaling impact

Since contrail kube-manager runs in kubernets-master, there is an additional latency between contrail kube-manager and contrail config. Today the contrail kube-manager token (to communicate to kuberenets-api-server) is obtained by kubectl command (which can be run only in k8s-maser). We need to investigate how to get the token from any where.
