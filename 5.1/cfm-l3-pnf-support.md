# 1. Introduction
This spec covers the design and implementation of providing the L3 PNF support for creating service chains for inter L3 VRFs traffic only. 

# 2. Problem statement

To allow inter LR (Logical Router) traffic to go through service chain, we need to insert a PNF device with service functions. This PNF device will be attached to L3 VNI capable devices (TOR or Spine).

#### Use cases
The main use case is to allow inter LR traffic to go through service chaining works for traffic between BMS

# 3. Proposed solution
In order to address the above problem we propose the following solution:
- PNF is attached to L3 VNI capable devices (TOR or Spine) in active-active mode
- Service VRFs: Dedicated Left and Right service VRFs will be created by Contrail on QFX device. These are distinct VRFs from the tenant VRFs. PNF device will also have a separate Left and Right VRF
- When the user creates the service instance, user must have a knob to select whether to use BGP between QFX (where PNF is atatched) and PNF routing instance itself or to configure static routes to divert the traffic from QFX to SRX
- When the user creates the service instance, user must have a knob to select whether service VRFs are SHARED (Left and Right service VRFs are same as Logical router VRF) or not SHARED (Left and Right VRF instances on QFX are distinct from the Logical Router VRF)
- Devices operating as service functions in service chaining must be associated to
      - A physical role: [PNF]
      - An overlay role: [L3PNF]
- QFX must be associated to an overlay role [Service-attachement) if it is connected to PNF device
- PNF will be discovered and on-boarded in the contrail fabric.

## 3.1 Alternatives considered
#### NA

## 3.2 API schema changes
As of now, changes are required in Service Appliance Set and Service Instance object.
- Service Appliance set object should have an attribute to indicate whether this is for PNF device or VNF device
- Service Appliance object should have an attribute to indicate whether Firewall configuration on the PNF device needs to be done by contrail or manually
- Service Instance object should have an attribute to select whether to use BGP between QFX or static routing
- Service Instance object should have an attribute to select whether service VRFs are shared or not shared
- Service Instance object should specify the Logical Routers that are to be attached to the Left and Right side of the PNF in the port tuple along with the Left and Right side of the VNI capable device
- New physical role (PNF) and overlay role (L3PNF) will be defined for PNF devices

## 3.3 User workflow impact
- User enters the management subnet for discovery of PNF device
- Using the management subnet, PNF device is discovered and on-boarded in the contrail fabric. It is assumed that underlay connectivity is already set-up between PNF device and Spine
- PNF device is associated with physical role (PNF) and an overlay role (L3PNF)
- User also enters the namespace for service chain subnets which will be used by IPAM to allocate IP addresses for interfaces participating in service chain
- User creates the service appliance set under Configure > Infrastructure > Service Appliance Sets. It is created with an attribute to indicate that this is for PNF device
- User creates service template under Configure > Services > Service Templates. Virtualization Type is set to Physical Device and this template is associated to the service appliance set previously created.
- User also selects the interfaces to be used (Left, Right or Management)
- User creates the Service appliance under Configure > Infrastructure > Service Appliances. User should add the left and right interfaces of the PNF device (from the drop-down list of interfaces already onboarded in the fabric)
- User creates PNF service instance under Configure > Services > Service Instances. User needs to select the service template to use and also select the corresponding left and right network in the port tuple
- Left port tuple consists of left logical router and left side interface on the spine which connects to the PNF device.
- Right port tuple consists of right logical router and right side interface on the spine which connects to the PNF device

## 3.4 UI changes
- Support for discovery/onboarding of PNF device. New physical and overlay roles discussed above needs to be supported
- Support for new namespaces in fabric onboarding
- Support for adding new attribute in Service Appliance set to indicate either PNF or VNF device
- Support for adding service appliance under service appliance set
- When creating service appliance, user should be able to select whether firewall is configured manually or by Contrail
- User can create/edit/modify a Service Template to create a new PNF Service Template
- User creates the Service Instance referring to previously created Service Template
- While instantiating the service, user should be able to select the below:
    - Whether to use BGP between QFX and SRX routing instance or static routing
    - Whether to use shared VRF or non shared VRF
- User then selects the Logical Routers that are to be attached to the Left and Right side of the PNF in the Service Instance

## 3.5 Notification impact
#### Describe any log, UVE, alarm changes

# 4. Implementation
## 4.1 PNF discovery and on-boarding in contrail fabric
- Only brownfield deployment is supported for the PNF device
- PNF is attached to L3 VNI capable devices (TOR or Spine) in active-active mode
- Using management subnet, PNF needs to be discovered in the fabric
- Once PNF is discovered, PNF physical role is assigned to the device.
- After discovery, all the underlay interfaces on the PNF device (could be a physical port or an Aggregate ethernet port) are on-boarded

In the data model diagram below, we have one spine QFX and one SRX PNF device discovered and on-boarded to the fabric via the existing brownfield on-boarding workflow. The underlay physical link between the QFX and SRX is discovered if LLDP is enabled on QFX and SRX.

## 4.2 Tenant Virtual Networks with separate Logical Routers for inter-VN traffic

This is existing contrail virtual network (VN) creation workflow. In this workflow, we create virtual networks for Dev, QA, pre-sales and post-sales teams. We also create the logical routers (LR) for engineering and sales departments. Intra-department traffic is allowed by adding dev/QA VNs to the engineering department LR and pre-sales/post_sales VNs to the sales department.

## 4.3 Service Template creation for the PNF device
- Under Network Policy-> Service Template tab, user needs to create a Service Template to create a new PNF service template
- In UI dialog, user needs to specify "physical_device" as the service_virtualization_type and service type "firewall"
- User also needs to select the PNF device from a pick list of physical routers onboarded previously (See 4.1). This pick list should only show those devices assigned with "PNF" physical role and "firewall" overlay role.
- Once user selects the PNF device, he or she also need to specify the left and right physical interfaces for service traffic. UI should only show those physical interfaces that connects to the spine devices.

In the following diagram, the green objects are the data model objects for the service template.

## 4.4 Service Instance Creation from Template
- Under Network Policy-> Service Instance tab, user needs to create a Service Instance referring to a previously created service template
- User then selects the logical routers that are to be attached to the Left and Right side of the PNF device along with Left and Right side of QFX device.
- User then needs to choose to enable BGP for routing or not.
    - If service instance is enabled for BGP attribute, configures BGP session between service VRF instances and SRX routing instances
    - If service instance is enabled for static routing, user needs to configures static routes for LRs pointing to the PNF ifl as next-hop

While creating fabric, user needs to specify the IP address pool for service chain subnets, which will be used by IPAM to allocate IP addresses for the device interface and the PNF interface. This pool should not overlap with the virtual network IP address pool.

<img src="images_L3_PNF_Support/pnf-chaining-data-model-04.png" alt="topology">

At this point, contrail configures the below on the TOR or Spine device:
- Left and Right service VRF must be configured in each device to which PNF is attached
- Left and Right VRF must be configured on the PNF device for each service instance
- If service instance is enabled for non shared VRF attribute, creates the Left and Right service VRFs and route leaking from tenant VRF to Left and Right VRF
- If service instance is enabled for shared VRF attribute, contrail will use the Logical router VRFs instead of creating new service VRFs
- Configures the VLAN and the IP addresses on the device interface and the PNF interface
- Configures these ifls into the Left and Right VRF
- Created Left and Right VRF on SRX

##4.4 Tasks breakdown
- Support for discovery and on-boarding of PNF device (SRX model) in contrail fabric â€“ This involves changes in Ansible playbooks for device discovery and device on-boarding. Node profile and roles needs to be enhanced to support new physical role (PNF) and overlay roles
- New overlay role (L3 service chain) needs to be defined for Spine device. Overlay role (L3PNF) needs to be defined for PNF device
- Support for adding a new physical plug-in in device manager for PNF physical role.
- API server changes to incorporate data model changes. This may involve some changes in schema transformer as well
- Pre-hooks in API server for validating PNF left and right interface assignment when creating the service template
- Pre-hooks in API server for validating left and right LR assignment to the service instance
- DM changes to listen for new objects notification and building the local cache
